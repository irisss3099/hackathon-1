# 📝 Assessments

Your performance in this course will be evaluated through a series of hands-on projects:

### 📦 ROS 2 Package Development Project
You will develop a ROS 2 package from scratch to control a simulated robot, demonstrating your understanding of nodes, topics, and services.

### 🕹️ Gazebo Simulation Implementation
You will create a complete Gazebo world with a robot model (URDF/SDF), including simulated sensors and a basic environment.

### 👁️ Isaac-based Perception Pipeline
Using the NVIDIA Isaac platform, you will build and test a hardware-accelerated perception pipeline for tasks like object detection or VSLAM.

### 🏆 Capstone: Simulated Humanoid with Conversational AI
This final project combines all learned concepts. You will deploy a simulated humanoid that can accept a natural language voice command and execute a multi-step task involving navigation, perception, and manipulation.
